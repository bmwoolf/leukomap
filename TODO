## Planned Pipeline Tasks

- [x] Load Caron et al. scRNA-seq data into `AnnData` format
- [x] Train a latent model using scVI for clustering
- [x] Visualize embeddings with UMAP
- [x] Integrate a healthy bone marrow reference (Human Cell Atlas) to detect abnormal clusters
- [x] Perform differential expression between clusters
- [ ] Run Azimuth (Seurat), CellTypist, and SingleR (R) for auto cell type labeling
- [ ] Compare auto vs manual annotations (e.g. ARI/NMI)
- [ ] Load into Cellxgene and Cirro for interactive visualization
- [ ] Run pseudotime analysis with Monocle3 and scVelo to trace leukemia progression
- [ ] Run single-cell GSEA using `GSVA`, `fgsea`, and `ssGSEA`
- [ ] Link DEGs to perturbation signatures via LINCS1000 / Enrichr
- [ ] Highlight top candidate pathways and drugs per cluster
- [ ] turn scripts into actual classes, something that can be integrated into someone else's pipeline
- [ ] Wrap analysis in Nextflow with Docker/Conda for portability
- [ ] Use `nf-core` template
- [ ] output as CSV and JSON, ready for ML and ontology integration
    Annotated Clusters: Cell type labels for leukemia subtypes
    Druggable Targets: Genes linked to drug compounds
    Differential Expression: Marker genes per cluster
- [ ] Auto-generate publication-quality figures and PDF/PowerPoint summaries
